# Decisions Log
- 2025-08-26: Adopted nine-agent pipeline + Supervisor/Reviewer gates for legal SEO domain.
- 2025-01-27: **Sprint 0 Sequencing Decision** - Prioritized infrastructure bootstrap (S0-002) before content ingestion (ING-101) to ensure Supabase connectivity. Blocked downstream tasks to prevent null work. Rationale: Foundation-first approach aligns with 90m session constraint and reduces rework risk.
- 2025-01-27: **Geographic Scope Expansion** - Updated target market from California-only to nationwide USA coverage. Rationale: Broader market increases content opportunities, traffic potential, and scales RevOps impact across all US legal markets. Content strategy will adapt to cover federal law + state-specific variations where relevant.
- 2025-01-27: **Cursor IDE Optimization** - Enhanced .cursor/config.json with agent role mapping, pinned files, and performance exclusions. Added .cursorignore for faster indexing. Rationale: Optimized IDE experience for 9-agent workflow with context discipline and faster performance.
- 2025-01-27: **Sprint 1 Content Strategy** - Chose AI readiness as Week 1 pillar topic with ethics/compliance and RevOps metrics as supporting spokes. Rationale: AI readiness is highest search volume + commercial intent for law firm buyers, while spokes address key implementation concerns (compliance) and measurement (RevOps).
- 2025-01-27: **Sprint 2 Content Production Decision** - Expanded from 3 to 6 comprehensive articles covering full legal AI implementation spectrum. Rationale: Market research showed demand for comprehensive guides across AI readiness, implementation, ethics, vendor selection, change management, and RevOps metrics. This creates a complete content ecosystem.
- 2025-01-27: **Frontend Architecture Choice** - Selected Next.js with MDX for content management over static site generators. Rationale: Next.js provides better SEO performance, server-side rendering capabilities, and easier content updates. MDX enables rich content formatting while maintaining developer experience.
- 2025-01-27: **Image Generation Strategy** - Implemented comprehensive image pipeline with hero, featured, social, and thumbnail variants for each article. Rationale: Visual content improves engagement, social sharing, and SEO performance. Multiple image formats ensure optimal display across all platforms.
- 2025-01-27: **Automation Pipeline Design** - Built weekly scheduler with job queue system rather than simple cron jobs. Rationale: Job queue provides better error handling, retry logic, and monitoring capabilities. This enables 32-minute automated content cycles with proper failure recovery.
- 2025-01-27: **Content Quality Gates** - Implemented multi-stage review process with Writer, Editor, and Reviewer agents. Rationale: Legal content requires high accuracy and compliance. Multi-agent review ensures quality while maintaining automated workflow efficiency.
- 2025-01-27: **Analytics Integration Priority** - Chose GA4 real-time integration as next milestone over GSC setup. Rationale: GA4 provides immediate performance insights and user behavior data. GSC requires longer setup time and provides search-specific metrics that are secondary to overall site performance.
- 2025-01-27: **Production Deployment Strategy** - Decided to complete analytics integration before full production deployment. Rationale: Analytics data is essential for measuring success and optimizing content. Production monitoring without analytics data provides limited value.
- 2025-09-26: **Native Legal Transformation** - Rebranded platform from "SEO Machine" to "Native Legal" with focus on AI Native Transformation Engine for law firms. Rationale: Better market positioning, clearer value proposition, and practice-area agnostic design for long-term scalability.
- 2025-09-26: **Practice-Area Agnostic Strategy** - Built platform to serve all practice areas from launch with universal workflows and customizable content. Rationale: Broader market opportunity, scalable architecture, and ability to address pain points across multiple legal specialties simultaneously. Focus on universal challenges (collections, compliance, AI adoption) that affect all law firms.
- 2025-09-26: **Frontend Integration Decision** - Integrated Next.js frontend into main repository and removed nested Git structure. Rationale: Simplified development workflow, unified version control, and better project organization for production deployment.
- 2025-09-26: **Image Standardization Strategy** - Implemented consistent gradient design for all blog post images with proper file naming conventions. Rationale: Professional appearance, SEO optimization, and scalable visual content pipeline.
- 2025-09-26: **Project Cleanup Decision** - Removed redundant directories (.github/, content/, docs/guides/) and consolidated project structure. Rationale: Reduced complexity, eliminated duplicate content, and improved maintainability for production deployment.
- 2025-09-26: **GitHub Repository Strategy** - Committed entire project to GitHub for version control and backup. Rationale: Professional development workflow, collaboration capabilities, and secure project backup.
- 2025-10-11: **Practice-Area Expansion Strategy** - Pivoted from family law Phase 1 to serving all practice areas from launch. Rationale: Broader market opportunity, more scalable architecture, universal challenges (collections, compliance, AI adoption) affect all law firms regardless of specialty. Single go-to-market strategy is more efficient than phased rollout.
- 2025-10-11: **Blog Post Consolidation Decision** - Removed duplicate blog post directories (/content/posts and /frontend-backup) keeping only /frontend/content/posts as single source of truth. Rationale: Eliminated confusion about which files to edit, prevented sync issues, reduced repository size, simplified project structure.
- 2025-10-11: **LinkedIn Primary Platform Strategy** - Selected LinkedIn as primary social media channel over Twitter/X for B2B legal market. Rationale: 90% of law firm partners use LinkedIn, 2.74% conversion rate vs 0.77% for Twitter, native long-form publishing, better B2B lead generation, professional context increases trust with legal buyers.
- 2025-10-11: **n8n Automation Platform Selection** - Chose n8n over Zapier/Make for social media automation. Rationale: Open-source (lower cost), more powerful workflow capabilities, self-hosting option for full control, better for complex multi-step automations, active community, no vendor lock-in. Cost: $30-50/month cloud or $10-30/month self-hosted vs $100+/month for Zapier at scale.
- 2025-10-11: **Archive Strategy for Completed Work** - Created context/docs/archive/ directory to separate completed sprints from active tasks. Rationale: Tasks.md was 140 lines of mostly completed work creating cognitive overhead. Archive preserves history while keeping active documentation focused and actionable. Clear separation improves team productivity and onboarding.
