### ABA Model Rules Foundation

The American Bar Association's Model Rules of Professional Conduct provide the foundational framework for AI ethics in legal practice. Key rules directly impacting AI implementation include:

**Model Rule 1.1 - Competence**
*"A lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client. Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation."*

**AI Implications:**

*"A lawyer shall not reveal information relating to the representation of a client unless the client gives informed consent, the disclosure is impliedly authorized in order to carry out the representation or the disclosure is permitted by the Rules."*

**AI Implications:**
- Strict requirements for protecting client data in AI systems
- Vendor due diligence obligations for cloud-based AI services
